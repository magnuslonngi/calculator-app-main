## My process

### Built with

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - Multi-platform framework
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - Programming language

### What I learned

With this project I learned a lot, I never used flutter before and I really like it. It's kinda similar to HTML structure, the widgets make easy the development, the thing that I like is that you only make one app and it works everywhere.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning about flutter, I found really interesting the way it works, but, I think I can get more knowledge to make even better apps.

### Useful resources

- [State managment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tm-R7ymwhc) - One of the things that take more time to learn was the state managment, this video is good for understand the basics.
- [Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0e2L5yoxFI) - With this I understand how the layout works compared to css.
- [Provider plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQuxrZE2dqA) - I found pretty difficult to manage state within widgets, so I found this plugin that make a lot easier to do that.
